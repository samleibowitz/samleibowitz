Hello friends! 👋

My name is Sam. I'm a software architect and team lead at [Tridiuum](https://tridiuum.com), part of [New Directions Behavioral Health](https://www.ndbh.com).  Prior to that I worked on the HealtheIntent, HealtheLife, and Soarian Clinicals platforms at [Cerner](https://cerner.com), 
and before that on Syngo Worfkow at Siemens. 

Most of the work I do day-do-day involves Ruby on Rails, but I'm also trying my hand at some Go. Once I feel like I have some Go under my belt,
I'm dying to check out some Elixir, because it's been a looooooong time since I did any functional programming.  When I'm not knee deep in nerdery, I also play fiddle (old time, bluegrass, and Cape Breton / Scottish) and do a little photography. 

If you want to say hello, you can always drop me a line on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-leibowitz/), 
or find me on Mastodon at https://hachyderm.io/@SamLeibowitz

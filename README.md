Hello friends! üëã

My name is Sam. I'm a software architect and team lead at [Lucet](https://lucethealth.com), which was previously Tridiuum and New Directions Behavioral Health.  Prior to that I worked on the HealtheIntent, HealtheLife, and Soarian Clinicals platforms at [Cerner](https://cerner.com), 
and before that on Syngo Worfkow at Siemens. 

These days, I don't do a lot of coding day to day, having been mired in the world of devoppery. In my spare time, I bang around a bit in Go and Rust.   When I'm not knee deep in nerdery, I also play fiddle (old time, bluegrass, and Cape Breton / Scottish) and do a little photography. 

If you want to say hello, you can always drop me a line on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-leibowitz/) where I guess I am for professional reasons? or something? Or, at [Hachyderm](https://hachyderm.io/@SamLeibowitz) where I tend to talk about nerdery, or at [on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/samleibowitz.bsky.social), where I occasionally s***post and am insufferable about politics.
